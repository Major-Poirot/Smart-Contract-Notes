## Notes:
1. In Blockchain, Secret Key or Mneumonic is used with the Account No/Name to generate a Hash, and this Hash will be used as the Private key for that particular Account. This Private key will be used later to generate a Public key and This can be shared with others.
Also, If an additional account for the same Secret Key is needed, a new Hash with the Secret Key and the Name of the 2nd Account will be used to generate a Hash, which will be considered as the Private Key for the 2nd Account.
